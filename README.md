# repeater
a very specific macro operation that won't make sense to anyone else

I made this to go along with my other addon -- [tkit](http://github.com/dustractor/tkit) -- as a way to repeat an operator (or several operators) and automate the process of leaving edit mode, duplicating the object, going into edit mode on the new object, duplicating the selected edges, inverting the selection, then leaving edit mode and re-selecting the original object and going back into edit mode.
